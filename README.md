# Filter-and-Wrapper-based-methods
The aim of this project is to find most important features in the given dataset using different algorithms and compare them. You will use the filter and wrapper based methods and make comparison of how the feature selection affects the performance of the model.

The problem is to predict the type of class on the basis of the chemical analysis. The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by criminological investigation. At the scene of the crime, the glass left can be used as evidence (if it is correctly identified!).
The data set has 214 instances and 9 features and a class label (which can take 7 different category of values). The following are the 9 features:
[1] RI refractive index
[2] Na Sodium
[3] Mg Magnesium
[4] Al Aluminum
[5] Si Silicon
[6] K Potassium
[7] Ca Calcium
[8] Ba Barium
[9] Fe Iron

Find the order of most significant to least significant features using the following feature selection algorithms:
1. Filtering Methods
- Chi-Squared (Categorical Variables)
- Information Gain
2. Wrapper-based Method - Recursive Feature Elimination (You may use K-Nearest Neighbor classifier as the underlying classification algorithm)
